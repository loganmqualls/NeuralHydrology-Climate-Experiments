Although deep learning hydrological models provide the most accurate streamflow predictions to-date, concerns about their reliablility in real-world conditions have been raised. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models have demonstrated a unique ability to extrapolate in such scenarios, addressing problems like predictions in ungaged basins and extreme event detection (Hrachowitz et al., 2013; Frame et al., 2021). Hydrological responses are prone to change, particularly under changing climate conditions. To investigate LSTM robustness under climate change, biased train and test were created to simulate changing climate distributions. By training the model on data from hydrological years characterized by one climate extreme and quantifying their predictive ability on test years characterized by the opposite extreme, we can simulate climate nonstationarity and begin to assess model robustness.

This repository is designed to create climate experiments for both NeuralHydrology LSTM and Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting (SAC-SMA) models using the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-Sample Studies (CAMELS) dataset(https://ral.ucar.edu/solutions/products/camels). This repository is designed to work with CAMELS version 2 to have the CAMELS directory in the main directory with the Jupyter Notebooks. 

NeuralHydrology (NH) is a Python library specifically designed for deep learning hydrological modeling and offers a variety of LSTM model designs (Kratzert et al., 202X). NH provides a flexible framework for data integration and model customization and includes several detailed walk-through examples to help get you started. More information can be found at their documentation webpage (https://neuralhydrology.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and the GitHub repository (https://github.com/neuralhydrology/neuralhydrology/blob/master/docs/source/index.rst). This repository is designed to work with NH in the "nh" directory.

The SAC-SMA model used in these experiments are from Upstream-Tech and includes the Snow-17 model. This code provides a Python interface and is specifically designed to use NH's configuration files. More information and code can be found at their GitHub repository (https://github.com/Upstream-Tech/SACSMA-SNOW17). This repository is designed to work with the SAC-SMA model in the "sacsma" directory.

In the NeuralHydrology-Climate-Experiments folder there are several directories and Jupyter Notebooks. The Jupyter Notebooks are numbered to detail the average workflow of calculating dynamic climate indices --> creating climate experiments --> configuring models --> ensembling model runs --> in-depth analyses --> visualizations. The "fundamental" notebooks are numbered (1, 2a/b, 3a/b) and indicate the process from the creation of dynamic climate indices to the ultimate ensembling of the final model runs. Notebooks starting with the letter "**A**..." indicate a type of **A**nalysis that can be performed and Notebook starting with the letter "**F**..." indicate types of figures and/or tables summarizing experimental results.


The config_complementaries folder contains a variety of files to be used as inputs into the models, including dummy configuration files, basin lists that define which basins data will be sourced from, and, most importantly, dynamic climate indices files and train/test set files. The "nwm" directory also contains data from the National Water Model that will be used as a benchmark model for the LSTM and SAC-SMA models (https://github.com/jmframe/nwm-post-processing-with-lstm). The "nh" directory contains an environment.yml file for NH as well as a "configs" dir to store configuration files made by notebook 2. Similarly, SAC-SMA contains the SACSMA-Snow-17 environment.yml file, its own "config" directory, and several directories necessary for successful model creation and calibration. Finally, the "functions" directory contains several Python script files of NH functions, with altered paths for use in this repository, necessary for model ensembling and analysis.

All Jupyter Notebooks should be in the main folder, along with the "camels", "config_complementaries", "functions", "nh", "notebook_env_saves", and "sacsma" folders.
